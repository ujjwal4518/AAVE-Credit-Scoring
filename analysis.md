# üìä Credit Score Analysis ‚Äì Aave V2 Protocol

This document summarizes the credit scoring behavior of DeFi wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol, based on transaction history extracted from raw JSON data.

## üî¢ Score Distribution

Credit scores were calculated between **0 and 1000**, where:
- Higher scores indicate consistent deposit-repay activity, no liquidations.
- Lower scores reflect irregular usage, risk, or inactivity.

Based on the plot, the scores are heavily **right-skewed** toward low values.

### üßÆ Observed Bucket Distribution (approx.)

| Credit Score Range | # Wallets (Approx) | Interpretation |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0‚Äì100              | ~2600              | Mostly inactive, one-off or risky behavior |
| 100‚Äì200            | ~100               | Single-action wallets (borrow or redeem only) |
| 200‚Äì400            | ~600               | Active with some repayments, no liquidation |
| 400‚Äì600            | ~120               | Balanced usage with moderate volume |
| 600‚Äì800            | ~20                | Healthy activity, strong repayment |
| 800‚Äì1000           | Very Few / 0       | No wallets reached top trust tier |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Characteristics of Low-Scoring Wallets (0‚Äì200)

- One-time interaction (e.g., only a deposit or borrow)
- No repayment or poor behavior (liquidation present)
- Very low financial volume
- Potentially bots or test wallets

---

## ‚úÖ Characteristics of High-Scoring Wallets (400+)

- Multiple `deposit`, `repay`, `redeemunderlying` actions
- No liquidation events
- Balanced loan and repayment cycles
- Engaged over longer timeframes

## üìä Score Distribution Plot

![Credit Score Distribution](outputs/score_distribution.png)

- **Left-skewed peak (~2600 wallets)** at 0‚Äì50 indicates minimal engagement.
- A **smaller bump around 300‚Äì400** suggests a cluster of wallets with good behavior.
- Virtually **no wallets beyond 800**, reflecting strict penalties (e.g., for liquidation) and tight thresholds.

## üß† Scoring Weights Summary

| Feature             | Weight | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| Total Deposited     | 30%    | Measures trust and capital commitment |
| Total Repaid        | 20%    | Key signal of reliability |
| Total Withdrawn     | 20%    | Shows completed interactions |
| Total Borrowed      | 20%    | Penalized slightly |
| Liquidation         | -30%   | Heavy penalty if triggered even once |

Final score is normalized and scaled to a **0‚Äì1000** range.

## üìå Conclusion

The credit scoring algorithm effectively segments wallets by behavior. Majority of wallets are low scoring due to minimal or risky behavior, while only a small subset demonstrates well-rounded, trustable patterns suitable for DeFi lending.

This system can help:
- Flag risky borrowers
- Rank wallets for credit delegation
- Build trust layers for on-chain credit scoring
